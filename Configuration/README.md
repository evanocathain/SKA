<b>Coordinates</b>

The coordinates of the MID antennas and the Low stations are given in
this directory in several file formats - ascii, CSV and KML (Google
Map) formats. The coordinates are those obtained from the following
documents:

"SKA1-Low Configuration Coordinates - Complete Set",
SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422, Dewdney & Braun, 2016-05-31.

"SKA1-Mid Physical Configuration Coordinates", SKA-TEL-INSA-0000537,
Heystek, 2015-05-04.

These documents can be obtained from the SKA Astronomers'
Documentation Page here:

http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/documents/

Note that the centre of the Mid array is not defined in the above
document. However, as noted in the Baseline Design, the Mid array will
incorporate MeerKAT dishes and as such must be centred on the same
locaton as the MeerKAT array.

<b>Distributions</b>

One can convert the coordinates, in longitude and latitude, to
relative offsets from the array centres in metres by running
ang2dist.csh

One can then plot various distributions, e.g. the number of elements
or collecting as a function of distance from array centre etc.

<b>Google Maps</b>

Since a January 2017 update to Google Maps you can now upload CSV
files directly into Google Maps and this is probably the easiest way
to make a Google Map. Simply click on 'Your Places'->'Maps'->'Create
Map' and then import the CSV files and customise as desired.

An example of doing this can be seen at:
